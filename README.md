# hello-world
Just following instructions here.
My name is numerotu (not really but close enough)
I have joined the Github community to further my knowledge and skills in SQL. 
I am a Science graduate but that wasn't cutting it for me. I was looking for something more challenging and applicable to all facets of life.
That is how I got into SQL and database management. I self-taught myself SQL and currently seeking a Marketing Analyst position because that is what interest me. 
I want to learn why things are going right and wrong and be able to support my arguments.
Spare time: football (or any sport - yes I consider golf to be a sport), social media (got to get that insta) and hiking!
Food = simple --> burgers, pizza and sushi...schwarmas are amazing as well 
Thank you in advance to those who help me out and I will return the favour when I am skilled enough.
Gitty up!
