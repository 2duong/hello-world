# hello-world
Just following instructions
My name is numerotu (not really but close enough)
I have joined the Github community to further my knowledge and skills in SQL. 
I am a Science graduate but that wasn't cutting it for me. The paychecks were also abysmal. 
That is how I got into SQL and database management. I self-taught myself SQL and seeking a Marketing Analyst position because that is what interest me. I want to how well things are doing and why are things not doing well. 
Spare time: football (or any sport - yes golfing is a sport), social media and hiking!
Food = simple --> burgers, pizza and sushi
Thank you in advance to those who help me out and I will return the favour when I am skilled enough.
Gitty up!
